#Elevator Pitch
Have you ever wanted to know whether the vaccination rate of a school in your neighborhood? Maybe you're concerned since you're about to put your children in kindergarten, or you could be looking to identify schools where there aren't enough vaccinations to provide herd immunity against measles, mumps or rubella? Do you want the information to be individualized, as oppposed to being plotted on a giant map?

This application **will allow users to quickly type in the name of a nearby K-8 school to determine its vaccination rate.** This personalized app is easier to use than similar ones made by organizations like The New York Times and Hollywood Reporter. Using this app can help educate parents or curious neighbors as to whether their local schools have met their seal of approval when it comes to vaccination rates. It's also a look at the most current data from the 2015-16 school year.

#Data
*1.* My primary source of data comes from the California Department of Health.
https://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/Pages/ImmunizationLevels.aspx
The site has .xls files of vaccination rates for students enrolled in kindergarten and seventh-grade. The data contains unique identifiers like school code, county, school name, vaccination rate and the percentage of students with a belief or medical exemption from vaccines. I plan on *adding* the two .xls files together to get one master list of rates in kindergartens and middle schools across the state.

*2.* My secondary source of data comes from the California Department of Education.
