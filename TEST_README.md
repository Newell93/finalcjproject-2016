#App Name: California's War Dead

#Pitch

Hundreds of Californians have died fighting in the Iraq war. It seems like our paper has one or two young soldier obituaries every week. But what does it mean to say 'hundreds have died'? What if there was a way to break down the big number and humanize every California soldier who has died? It could be used an informational and personal tool. Think of it as an interactive app that describes every soldier who died (e.g. name, age, position, hometown) and allows friends and family to share their favorite memories. It is automated so it will check with the Department of Defense once a day to see if new soldiers should be added.

This site is a great resource tracking trooper deaths on an international scale. It's a good source for names of soldiers from the USA and UK who died in Iraq, but its interface is poorly constructed. The homepage, which tracks death is an Excel-like spreadsheet, is not aesthetically pleasing and there seems to be no attempt to humanize the numbers. This is the kind of data desensitation that I referred to earlier.

It's hard to find personal casualty information displayed on the Defense Department website.
