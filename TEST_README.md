#App Name: California's War Dead

#Pitch

Hundreds of Californians have died fighting in the Iraq war. It seems like our paper has one or two young soldier obituaries every week. But what does it mean to say 'hundreds have died'? What if there was a way to break down the big number and humanize every California soldier who has died? It could be used an informational and personal tool. Think of it as an interactive app that describes every soldier who died (e.g. name, age, position, hometown) and allows friends and family to share their favorite memories. It is automated so it will check with the Department of Defense once a day to see if new soldiers should be added.

http://www.icasualties.org/

This site is a great resource tracking trooper deaths on an international scale. It's a good source for names of soldiers from the USA and UK who died in Iraq, but its interface is poorly constructed. The homepage, which tracks death is an Excel-like spreadsheet, is not aesthetically pleasing and there seems to be no attempt to humanize the numbers. This is the kind of data desensitation that I referred to earlier.

It's hard to find personal casualty information displayed on the Defense Department website. This is a link to a PDF where one can find the total number of soldiers who died in Iraq, but it's an aggregate number that fails to individualize the data.

#Data

We took the names from the Department of Defense and icasualties.org and filtered the names of soldiers who said they were from California.

We then joined the database of California names with soldiers who were written about in our obituaries section. We could then extract the obituary text and paste it on each soldier's profile to give readers a sense of who these individuals were. 

#Filtering Options

This app is terrific at filtering our data. The homepage contains: thumbnail pictures of the five soldiers who died most recently, the total number killed (which can be searched by last name) and categories our readers might like to peruse. For example, we grouped deaths by cemetery, hometown, marital status, high school and gender. A graduate of Sultana High School in Hesperia could click on the school name to see all the fallen soldiers who had graduated from this high school.

#Detail View

Clicking on a specific soldier gives readers a thumbnail image with the soldier's name and age in **bold type.**
