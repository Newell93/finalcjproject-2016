#App Name: California's War Dead

#Pitch / Inspiration

Hundreds of Californians have died fighting in the Iraq war. It seems like our obituary section has one to two young soldiers every week. But what does it mean to say 'hundreds have died'? What if there was a way to break down the big number and humanize every California soldier who has died? It could be used an informational and personal tool. Think of it as an interactive app that describes every soldier who died (e.g. name, age, position, hometown) and allows friends and family to share their favorite memories. It is automated so it will check with the Department of Defense once a day to see if new soldiers should be added.
